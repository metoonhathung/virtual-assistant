        RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS
        ----------------------------
        When responding to me, please output a response in one of two formats:

        **Option #1:**
        Use this if you need to use a tool. Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:
        ```json
        {{
            "action": string, \ The action to take. Must be one of {tool_names}
            "action_input": string \ The input to the action
        }}
        ```

        **Option #2:**
        MUST use this if you have a direct response to say to the Human, or if you do not need to use a tool. Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:
        ```json
        {{
